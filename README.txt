Purpose:


List of files and their usage:
1. csver.py -> Takes a 'comma-seperated values(csv)' file as input, parses the file and outputs a dictionary in the form of a 'list of lists' with the fields.

2. Unify.py -> Takes a 'list of lists' dictionary as input and outputs the same list with fields standardized against a "correct" dictionary.
